This is done in the Shooting phase, similar to Striking the Anvil. Grounding the Anvil is automatic and allows the Runesmith to select one of the Striking the Anvil conditions, without the need to roll for them, which will last till the end of the game. Grounding the Anvil also grants the Dwarven army a resolve bonus; for the rest of the game Dwarven troops ignore the Command modifier for being under strength.
